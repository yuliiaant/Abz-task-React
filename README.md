## The challenge

- Working with REST API (GET).
a. Implement the “Working with a GET request” block according to the mockup and API
documentation. Display 6 users on the API request result page. The "Show more" button
should be hidden when the last page of API query results is reached. Users are sorted by
registration date (the newest first).
b. To display radio buttons on the registration form, use the GET /positions method from the API
documentation.
- Working with REST API (POST) – registration form block “Working with a POST Request”
a. Implement front-end validation in accordance with mockups and API documentation.
b. Implement the business logic of the registration form in accordance with mockups and API
documentation.
c. After successful registration, update the list of users in the “Working with a GET request” block.
If the “Show more” button has been clicked (i.e. more than one page of users has been loaded
from the API), collapse all and display only the first page of the result of the GET request. As a
result, the new user will be displayed first and you will be able to check the correctness of the
form without reloading the page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
